                        Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of Simplify. The use of Simplify is only possible with a valid Simplify Account. In order to get an account the responsible lecturer will create one.
                        The processing of personal data, such as the e-mail address of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to Simplify. By means of this data protection declaration, Simplify would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
                        As the controller, Simplify has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.

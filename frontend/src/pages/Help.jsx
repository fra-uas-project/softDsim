                          SoftDsim is a Django-based web application designed for simulating project management scenarios to be used in the Project Management module at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences.
                          The web application SoftDSim was developed in 2022 by a student project group. It serves as a project management simulation for educational purposes. This simulation allows students to take on the role of a project manager and simulate a dynamic project management scenario. In doing so, students must make decisions to complete the scenario as successfully as possible, considering the magical project management triangle (quality, cost, time). The tool offers various actions to choose from, including adding or removing developers, setting overtime and Training, as well as assigning tasks such as solving tasks, testing, or bugfixing.
                        </p>

                          SoftDSim is an educational simulation designed to raise awareness among students about decision-making in project management. The scenarios in SoftDSim can only be created by professors. Students have the valuable opportunity to play these scenarios and gain an authentic insight into the work of a project manager. The main goal of the simulation is to achieve a sustainable learning effect by having noticeable effects following all actions, even if they go beyond a realistic extent. This creates a more immersive learning experience. The effects achieved include both the impacts of the simulation state that students can monitor on a dashboard, as well as the direct consequences of the actions taken by the students.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                          For example, increased team motivation can lead to a greater number of completed tasks, while increased stress can result in more errors. It is important that the effects of the students' actions are tangible, whether it be in the form of increased stress during overtime or enhanced project familiarity through conducting meetings.</p>
                        <p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                          Overall, SoftDSim enables students to have an interactive and realistic learning experience in the field of project management, strengthening their decision-making and problem-solving skills.</p>

                          By selecting a scenario from the overview, the "Story" of the scenario opens. The Story describes the scenario and the project's content. It contains as much information as possible about a project, aiming to make the scenario execution easier and more intuitive for the user. The Story of a simulation provides a comprehensive overview of the project and allows participants to have important information at their disposal. For example, it may outline the project prerequisites and the project management methodology to be applied. The Story helps students to better understand the context of the scenario and facilitates the identification of challenges and decisions to be made during the simulation. The "Start Simulation" button initiates the simulation. During the simulation itself, the Story remains accessible, allowing participants to refer to relevant information whenever needed. The ability to open and reread the Story during the simulation promotes a deeper understanding of the scenario, supports the learning objectives of the project management module, and facilitates achieving a good outcome within the simulation.

Information about these tasks is visible in the graph. The unit tests are not counted among the “Done” tasks. Therefore, the number of unit tests is subtracted from the “Done” tasks. However, integration tests may add additional tasks, which must be completed afterwards.             </AccordionPanel>

                          In this area of the user interface, the average mood of the employees can be observed during the project based on three attributes. It shows the percentage of how the employees' mood develops or changes after each iteration. The better the values for each parameter throughout the simulation, the better the efficiency of the Employees and the outcome of the simulation will be in the end. Ideally, the stress value should be low, and the motivation and familiarity values should be high.
                          <p>• <strong>Stress</strong>: If the tasks are too demanding and the employees are overwhelmed, the stress value increases. The deadline is also crucial because the closer it gets, the higher the stress level becomes. However, for an ideal and efficient workflow, the stress value should not be at 0 either. An ideal stress value would be around 20. Within the simulation, it is possible to lower the stress level through stress-reducing measures. An example of this would be team meetings. Hovering the mouse over the "Team Event" field also indicates that it reduces stress.</p>
                          <p>• <strong>Motivation</strong>: The motivation value is also crucial for efficiency, as without motivation, the employees' mood decreases. Motivation is high when employees feel well-treated. For example, a team event would increase the motivation of the employees.</p>
                          <p>• <strong>Familiarity</strong>: Familiarity describes the employees' familiarity with the tasks. Familiarity is important for employees to work efficiently together in the project and complete the tasks. Familiarity increases, for example, through the scheduling of meetings.</p>

                          Events are occurrences in the simulation triggered by specific trigger points. Trigger points are defined conditions that must be met for an event to be triggered. These events can have various effects and influence the behavior of the simulation. The events in the simulation help simulate challenges that a project team may face. They can be positive or negative events. A negative event, for example, could be the addition of additional tasks due to an increased stress level. A positive event could be the reduction of some tasks due to a high familiarity value. Depending on how well or poorly a simulation is conducted, positive or negative events can occur. An example of a trigger point could be when the stress level of team members in the simulation reaches 80% or higher. Once this trigger point is reached, an event is triggered. In this case, the event could result in an increase of 20 in the number of “remaining tasks” in the simulation. This reflects increased workload and presents an additional challenge for the team. Therefore, the event serves as a warning and emphasizes the need for a lower stress level and increased attention to stress in the future.

                          At the end of a simulation, a project can be "delivered" or finished by clicking the "Finish Project" button, and after that the results are displayed. There is an option to deliver a project once 80% of the tasks have been completed. Each scenario has an end condition that must be met for the "Finish Project" button to appear. If the button does not appear and the end condition is not met, it sometimes makes more sense to manually end the project using the "Deliver" button. The results display the achieved scores for each criterion and the overall score for the project.

The maximum score that can be achieved is 100.</p>
                          <p>• <strong>Time Score:</strong> This score relates to the adherence to the project timeline. If the deadline is not met and more time is needed for the project, the score will be relatively low. The maximum score that can be achieved is 100.</p>

                          At the beginning of the project, it is important to select the appropriate project management method. For the simulation, this decision is crucial as the approach varies for each method. The chosen method can influence the project flow and outcome in the simulation. There are different approaches available: Scrum, Kanban, and the Waterfall approach. Scrum and Kanban are agile methods that emphasize adaptability and engagement. Scrum is based on flexibility and active participation. It is characterized by short iterations, regular meetings, and close collaboration within the team. This iterative approach allows for changing requirements throughout the project. The high transparency and communication in Scrum enable effective collaboration.
                          On the other hand, the Waterfall approach places a strong emphasis on detailed upfront planning. Therefore, the Waterfall approach is suitable when the requirements are well-defined from the beginning. Through its structured approach, the Waterfall method allows for precise planning, clear milestones, and accurate predictability of the project's progress. Scrum and Kanban are used when the requirements may change or need to be adapted during the project.

                          Under "Employees", staff members can be hired. There are different types of employees that can be hired. Employees with more experience can handle more tasks but are also more expensive than employees with less experience. The tasks that can be completed by the employees are divided into easy, medium and hard tasks. The error rate is higher for hard tasks than for easy tasks.
                          When selecting employees, it is important that not only one type of employee is selected. For high efficiency, it makes sense that as many different employees as possible are hired.

                          <strong>What are the differences between the employees?</strong><br />
                          The employees in the simulation differ in their roles and expertise. Each one of them brings unique skills and knowledge to the team. Seniors, for example, have more experience, cause fewer errors, and are more expensive. Juniors, for example, are much cheaper than seniors but do not have much experience and cause more errors. Software testers specialize in identifying and resolving bugs to ensure high-quality deliverables.

                          <strong>What is the best way to choose employees?</strong><br />
                          Before choosing the employees, one should understand the story of the scenario well to be able to use the right employees. The best way to choose employees would be to follow a comprehensive and balanced approach. Tasks should not be performed by only one type of employee, if possible. For high efficiency, however, as many different employees as possible should be hired.

                          <strong>How are events triggered in the simulation and what are their effects?</strong><br />
                          Events are occurrences in the simulation triggered by specific trigger points. Trigger points are defined conditions that must be met for an event to be triggered. These events can have various effects and influence the behavior of the simulation. The events in the simulation help simulate challenges that a project team may face. They can be positive or negative events. A negative event, for example, could be the addition of additional tasks due to an increased stress level. A positive event could be the reduction of some tasks due to a high familiarity value. Depending on how well or poorly a simulation is conducted, positive or negative events can occur. An example of a trigger point could be when the stress level of team members in the simulation reaches 80% or higher. Once this trigger point is reached, an event is triggered. In this case, the event could result in an increase of 20 in the number of "remaining tasks" in the simulation. This reflects increased workload and presents an additional challenge for the team. Therefore, the event serves as a warning and emphasizes the need for a lower stress level and increased attention to stress in the future.
